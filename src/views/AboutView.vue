          As a youth, his unique experiences fostered a lust for change and growth and have shaped
          who he is, personally and professionally. He briefly attended Mary Washington College in a
          pre-medical program and completed business courses at Concordia College and Carleton
          University before realizing his entrepreneurial spirit and an unexplored passion for
          designing and building. This realization started him off on his journey to become a
          skilled contractor and business owner.

          <p class="mb-6">
            he launched his first business, Markel Home Improvements, as a licensed flooring
            contractor servicing major building companies Richcraft and Tamarack Homes.
          </p>

          <p class="mb-6">
            After a few years in the flooring trade, he was ready for the next step of his journey
            and joined the Behr Paint Company where he was trained in Canada and the USA to become
            an expert in everything to do with paint.
          </p>

          <p class="mb-6">
            From flooring to paint, Aaron was ready to continue expanding his knowledge of the
            trades so he joined Carmichael Engineering, one of Canada’s leading experts in thermal
            system technologies. Through his time at Carmichael, Aaron gained experience in
            commercial heating and cooling system installations, ventilation, and roof replacements.
            He designed and built clean rooms, fulfilling major contracts for Primus, the Saudi
            Arabian Cultural Center, Canadian Blood Services, Export Development Canada, and
            Bridgewater. Leveraging his knowledge of heating and ventilation systems he built two
            hot yoga studios in Ottawa, Ontario.
          </p>

          <p class="mb-6">
            When he felt confident in his HVAC knowledge and skills, he decided to partner with a
            mechanical company to open his next business, T&M Mechanical. This company specialized
            in commercial and residential plumbing, ductwork, and heating and cooling. This
            partnership offered Aaron hands-on learning and opportunities to advance his technical
            skills. He took courses in electrical, solar design and mass solar panel implementation,
            and received many certifications. At this point in his career, he was able to install
            all the internal components of a building.
          </p>

          <p class="mb-6">
            Having mastered the interior, he was ready to work on filling his remaining knowledge
            gap: the exterior. With many connections in the construction industry, Aaron partnered
            with an experienced window and door specialist and together they opened Unique View
            Windows and Doors and specialized in exterior installations.
          </p>

          <p class="mb-6">
            As he was successfully implementing his plan to become skilled and knowledgeable in all
            areas of building construction, Aaron knew it was time to launch
            <strong>AIM Project Management</strong>, a full-service general contracting company.
            Operating since 2014, the project management team has over 40 years of residential and
            commercial construction experience and is Aaron’s flagship company.
          </p>

          <p class="mb-6">
            Through AIM, Aaron worked on many exciting projects, including restoration of the Billy
            Bishop WWI building, rebuilding of the Saudi Arabian Embassy’s air distribution system,
            installation of indoor pools, renovation of heritage buildings, basements and bathrooms,
            and building of home additions, cottages, decks and sheds. His latest and most defining
            projects include the complete design and building of the

          </p>
          <p class="mb-6">
            With his wealth of knowledge and experience built up over the years, Aaron’s motto has
            become “rethink construction” which continually pushes him to improve and find ways to
            embed sustainable and innovative practices into his companies. He believes there is
            always room to do things better (even those practices deeply entrenched in an industry's
            culture) and hopes to one day provide consultative services to those in the industry who
            also want to “rethink” and improve their business practices.
          </p>

          <p class="mb-6">
            Not only is Aaron an entrepreneur, but he also has a philanthropic nature and believes
            it’s important to contribute to his community. Projects he’s supported include: donating
            funds and materials to Habitat for Humanity, completing gratis work for Ronald McDonald
            House, donating tools and time in support of flood-relief efforts, donating space and
            food for an environmental community assembly, and sponsoring the building of a community
            garden.
          </p>

          <p class="mb-6">
            Aaron is the owner or co-owner of a suite of aligned businesses that uniquely position
            him to provide clients with a full scope of services from concept design to equipment
            rentals. He is a creator and visionary – a self-made contractor and business owner that
            is guided by making ethical choices to deliver quality results.
